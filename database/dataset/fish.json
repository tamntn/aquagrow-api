They thrive in temperatures ranging in the 50s and 60s, making them ideal for cool environments. This species of fish has a high food conversion ratio and grow quickly, although it may take up to 16 months to fully mature. In addition, trout are a desirable food source, loaded with protein and omega fatty acids.",

Conditions must be closely monitored to ensure pristine water, and proper oxygen and pH levels.  In addition, bass will not tolerate bright light or a poor feeding regime. Another downside is the long wait period to mature. Largemouth bass can take up to 18 months to reach its full size. Striped bass typically mature faster.",
